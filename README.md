# distance-monitor
This is the code for the distance monitor project that I posted on Instagram!

To build this project yourself, look at the list of materials that I put on my Instagram caption.

Once you've finished building the electronics, download the Arduino open source IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/.

Open up the IDE and copy the code from this repository (or write your own).

Find your Arduino board through Tools -> Port -> *your port*. It will be a serial connection.

Upload your code, and it should work now!

If you're not familiar with Arduino and don't want to spend hours trying to figure it out, you can always buy any of my projects cheap at ig: @thetaoretails ;)
